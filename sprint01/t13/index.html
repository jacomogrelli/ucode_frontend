    <h2>Hermione Granger</h2>

    <p> Hermione Jean Granger is a Muggle-born Gryffindor, who becomes best friends with Harry Potter and Ron Weasley.
      J.K. Rowling states that she was born on 19 September 1979 and she was nearly twelve when she first attended
      Hogwarts. She is an overachiever who excels academically and is described by J.K Rowling as a "very logical,
      upright and good" character. J.K. Rowling adds that Hermione's parents, two Muggle dentists, are a bit bemused
      by their odd daughter but "very proud of her all the same." They are well aware of the wizarding world and have
      visited Diagon Alley with her. Hermione was originally intended to have a sister, but the planned sibling did not
      make an appearance in the first Harry Potter novel and, as Rowling noted, it "seemed too late" to introduce the
      character after all of that. Rowling confirmed in a 2004 interview that Hermione is an only. <br>

      Rowling has described the character of Luna Lovegood as the "anti-Hermione" as they are so very different.
      Hermione's nemesis at Hogwarts is Pansy Parkinson, a bully based on real-life girls who teased the author during
      her school days. <br>

      owling stated that the character of Hermione carries several autobiographical influences: "I did not set out to
      make Hermione like me but she is...she is an exaggeration of how I was when I was younger." She recalled being
      called a "little know-it-all" in her youth. Moreover, she states that not unlike herself, "there is a lot of
      insecurity and a great fear of failure" beneath Hermione's swottiness. Finally, according to Rowling, next to
      Albus Dumbledore, Hermione is the perfect expository character; because of her encyclopaedic knowledge, she can
      always be used as a plot dump to explain the Harry Potter universe. Rowling also states that her feminist
      conscience is rescued by Hermione, "who's the brightest witch of her age" and a "very strong female
      character." <br>

      Hermione's first name is taken from a character in William Shakespeare's The Winter's Tale, though Rowling has
      said that the two characters have little to nothing in common otherwise. Rowling said that she wanted her name
      to be unusual since if fewer girls shared her name, fewer girls would get teased for it and it seemed that "a
      pair of professional dentists, who liked to prove how clever they are...gave r an unusual name that no-one
      could pronounce." Her original last name was "Puckle", but Rowling felt the name "did not suit her at all",
      and so the less frivolous Granger made it into the books and movies.</p>
