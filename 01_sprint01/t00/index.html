    </h2>
    <p>
      A superhero or superheroine is a stock character that possess abilities
      beyond those of ordinary people, who typically uses their powers to help
      <b>the world become a better place</b>, or is dedicated to protecting
      the public, and stopping evil. Superhero fiction is the genre of fiction
      that is centered on such characters, especially in American comic books
      since the 1930s (and later Hollywood films), as well as in Japanese
      media (including kamishibai, tokusatsu, manga, anime and video games)
      since the 1930s.

      Superheroes come from a wide array of different backgrounds and origins.
      Some superheroes (for example Batman and Iron Man) derive their status
      from advanced technology they create and use, while others (such as
      Superman and Spider-Man) possess non-human or superhuman biology or
      study and practice magic to achieve their abilities (such as Zatanna and
      Doctor Strange).
